## How to use

To replace the vowel with its "toned" version, 4 commands/hotkeys have been added.

| Command Name        | Shortcut |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Replace first tone  | "ALT" + "1"  |
| Replace second tone | "ALT" + "2"  |
| Replace third tone  | "ALT" + "3"  |
| Replace fourth tone | "ALT" + "4"  |

The letter "v" can be used to produce the "ǖ", "ǘ", "ǚ", "ǜ" tones the same way as it works with the vowels. (credit: [VishalJagan](https://github.com/VishalJagan))

## Additional features

Adds a status bar item to the status bar to remind you the order of the tones.
